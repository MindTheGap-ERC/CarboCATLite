## Old README

Content of the old README.txt file:

"double click on the file carboCATGUI.m to open Matlab and load this file.
Run the function either by enterting the function name carboCATGUI at the command prompt,
or by clicking run in the editor tab

The GUI should be reasonably intuitive; click on the Initialise button to set up the model
ready to run, then click on Run CA Model, then on PLot run and you should see the
results from the paramsProcess.txt and the paramsInputValues.txt input files I have set up
in the params folder. You can edit both of these files to run different models.
You can also use the code in the utilities folder to make new initial topography,
intial facies maps, sea-level curves and other inputs you might need to create
useful models

Any questions, e-mail peter.burgess@liverpool.ac.uk"
